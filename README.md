  [01] What is emmet ?
  
    • Emmet is a popular plugin for text editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom that enhances HTML and CSS coding efficiency through abbreviations. Key features include:
      ○ Abbreviation Expansion: Short codes expand into complete HTML/CSS structures.
      ○ Custom Snippets: Users can create personalized snippets.
      ○ Dynamic Abbreviations: Supports dynamic element naming and repetition.
      ○ Built-in Support: Available for many editors, with Visual Studio Code having it built-in.
  
  [02] What is the difference between a Library and Framework ?
  
    • The difference between a library and a framework lies in control and structure.
      
    Library -
    • Definition - A set of tools and functions you call as needed, giving you control over the application flow.
    • Example - React is a library for building UI's, where you manage component structure and state.
      ○ Libraries give you control of the app flow.
      ○ Libraries are flexible.
      ○ Libraries integrate into various parts.

    Framework -
    • Definition - Provides a structured architecture and controls the application flow, calling your code at specific points.
    • Example - Next.js is a framework built on React that dictates file structure, routing, and rendering processes.
      ○ Frameworks control the app flow.
      ○ Frameworks enforce structure.
      ○ Frameworks provide comprehensive solutions.

  [03] What is CDN ?
  
    • Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server. 
    • Primary goal of a CDN is to deliver content quickly, efficiently, & reliably to users across the globe.
  
  [04] Why do we use CDN ?
      
    • Improved Load Times -
      ○ Geographic Proximity - By serving content from servers closer to the user’s location, CDNs reduce latency and improve load times.
      ○ Caching - CDNs cache content at various locations, so when a user requests a webpage, the CDN can deliver the content from the nearest cache instead of the origin server.
    • Reduced Bandwidth Costs -
      ○ CDNs optimize the delivery of content, reducing the amount of data transferred from the origin server, which can lower bandwidth costs for website owners.
    • Enhanced Reliability and Availability -
      ○ Distributed Architecture - With content distributed across multiple servers, CDNs can handle server outages and network issues more effectively, ensuring continuous availability.
      ○ Load Balancing - CDNs can distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.
    • Scalability -
      ○ CDNs can handle large amounts of traffic and sudden spikes in demand, making it easier for websites to scale their operations globally.
    • Security -
      ○ DDoS Protection - CDNs provide protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by distributing traffic across many servers and employing various mitigation strategies.
      ○ SSL/TLS Encryption - Many CDNs offer SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring secure data transfer between users and servers.
  
  [05] What is crossorigin in JS script tag ?
  
    • The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to handle the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings for scripts. It is crucial for managing how cross-origin requests are made and how the responses are handled, enhancing both security and functionality when dealing with external scripts.
      
  [06] What is dependency injection ?
  
    • Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to manage and inject dependencies into an object or class, rather than creating the dependencies within the object itself. This pattern helps achieve better modularity, easier testing, and greater flexibility in the design of applications.
  
    • Key Concepts of Dependency Injection -
      ○ Dependency - An object or service that a class or module needs to function properly. For example, a UserService might depend on a DatabaseService to retrieve user data.
      ○ Injection - The process of providing the dependencies to a class or module, typically through a constructor, method, or property.
  
    • Types of Dependency Injection -
      ○ Constructor Injection.
      ○ Setter Injection.
      ○ Property Injection.
      
    • Benefits of Dependency Injection -
      ○ Improved Modularity
      ○ Easier Testing
      ○ Flexibility and Maintainability
      ○ Code Reusability
